# A little website coded with React, allowing anyone to wave at my rinkeby contract.

To launch the website on local, write this on your terminal:

### `npm start`

You'll need Metamask installed on your browser to be able to connect your wallet.
Then you will need some rinkeby eth (type "rinkeby faucet" on google to receive some on your eth wallet).
